This is a blockchain project involving "chain-of-custody"

The project will work something like this (concept is evolving so updates will be made):

Motivations:

1) Law enforcement team(s) or private investigation firms are acquired to collect evidence for a case.
2) Chain of custody is critical to the admissibility of the evidence in legal courts. 
3) Blockchain solutions provide an immutable tracebility of the evidence (so long as all participants are trustworthy) 
4) Blockchain technologies can help ease some of the more tedious aspects of chain of custody proceedings.
